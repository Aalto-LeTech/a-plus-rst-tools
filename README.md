A-plus RST tools
================

Provides tools to publish RST course content for mooc-grader and a-plus.

* http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/
* http://matplotlib.org/sampledoc/
* http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html


Creating a new course
---------------------

We recommend to start with a fork from the mooc-grader-rst-course repository
from Github.

    git clone -b rst --recursive https://github.com/Aalto-LeTech/mooc-grader-course.git

To compile the RST source into HTML the Python sphinx module is required.

    pip install sphinx

The course is compiled with a make.

    make

The tools can be later upgraded.

    git submodule update


Adding tools to existing course
-------------------------------

The tools can be added into a repository as a submodule.

    git submodule add git@github.com:Aalto-LeTech/a-plus-rst-tools.git a-plus-rst-tools

Then installation of sphinx, creation of RST document root and configuring sphinx are required.

    pip install sphinx
    sphinx-quickstart
    cp a-plus-rst-tools/conf.py .



List of directives and examples
-------------------------------

1. Graded questionnaire

```
    .. questionnaire:: 1 A50
      :submissions: 4
      :points-to-pass: 0

      This is a questionnaire number 1 that gives at maximum 50 points
      in category A. Students can make at most 4 submissions.
      This exercise is marked passed when 0 points is reached (the default).

      .. pick-one:: 10

        What is 1+1?

        a. 1
        *b. 2
        c. 3

        !b ยง Count again!
        c ยง Too much

      (Hints can be included or omitted in any question.)

      .. pick-any:: 10

        Pick two **first**.

        *a. this is **first**
        *b. this is **second**
        c. this is **third**

      .. freetext:: 30 string-ignorews-ignorequotes
        :length: 10

        A textual input can be compared with the model as int, float or string.
        Fourth option is regexp which takes the correct answer as a regular
        expression. Strings have comparison modifiers that are separated with hyphen.

        * ignorews: ignore white space (applies to regexp too)
        * ignorequotes: iqnore "quotes" around
        * requirecase: require identical lower and upper cases
        * ignorerepl: ignore REPL prefixes

        Here the correct answer is "test".

        test
        !test ยง Follow the instruction.
```

2. Feedback questionnaire

```
    .. questionnaire::
      :feedback:

      What do you think now?

      .. freetext::
        :required:
        :length: 100
        :height: 4
        :class: my-input-class

      .. agree-group::

        .. agree-item:: Did it work for you?
```

3. Submit an exercise

These type of exercises are configured separately for mooc-grader.
The directive will attach the exercise at this position.

```
    .. submit:: 2 A100
      :submissions: 100
      :config: exercises/hello_python/config.yaml
```

4. Submit a remote exercise

This exercise opens an external tool via LTI launch protocol.

    .. submit:: 3 B50
      :url: https://rubyric.com/edge/exercises/111/lti
      :lti: Rubyric+
      :lti_context_id: asdasd
      :lti_resource_link_id: asdasd


5. Active element input

This creates an input field for active element.

More active element examples can be found at https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/piitulr1/active-element-example

Tools for making clickable active element inputs: https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/piitulr1/click-input-editor

    .. ae-input:: id-for-input
    	:title: title of the input (displayed on the html page)
    	:default: default value for the input (displayed when the user has not
    	       submitted a solution)
    	:class: Any css classes that the active element exercise div should have
    					separated by a space (class1 class2 class3).
		  	      In the example course css-file:
		  	       - classes "active-element" and "ae-input" are used to style the
		  	         input element and can be modified as needed.
		  	       - classes "left" and "right" can be used to float the box left or
		  	         right, or "center" to align it centered.
    	:width: can be used to set the width of the element
    	:height: can be used to set the height of the input textarea
    	       (deafult with classes "active element" and "ae-input" is 150px)
    	:clear: "both" forces the element to a new line, "left" ("right") allows
    	       no floating elements on the left (right)
    	:type: use "file" for file inputs, "clickable" for clickable inputs, and
            "dropdown" for dropdown. For dropdowns, the available options should
            be listed after the type indicating "dropdown" in this
            format: "dropdown:option1,option2,option3"
      :file: (only for type clickable) path to the html file that contains
            the default clickable input


5. Active element output

This creates an output field for active element

More active element examples can be found at https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/piitulr1/active-element-example

    .. ae-output:: key-for-output
    	:config (required): path to the exercise configuration file
    	:inputs (required): ids of the input elements required for the output
    	:title: title of the output element
    	:class: Any css classes that the active element exercise div should have
    					separated by a space (class1 class2 class3).
		  	      In the example css-file:
		  	       - class "active-element" is used to style the
		  	         input element and can be modified as needed.
		  	       - classes "left" and "right" can be used to float the box left or
		  	         right, or "center" to align it centered.
    	:width: can be used to set the width of the element
    	:height: can be used to set the height of the output div (deafult
    	       with class "active element" is 150px)
    	:clear: "both" forces the element to a new line, "left" ("right") allows
    	       no floating elements on the left (right)
    	:type: default type is text; for image (png) outputs use "image"
    	:submissions: number of allowed submissions (default is unlimited for
    	       active elements)
    	:scale-size: no value; if this option is present, the output element
    	       height will scale to match content that has a defined height
